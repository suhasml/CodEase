/**
 * PublishForm.enhanced.tsx
 * 
 * This file serves as documentation for the enhancements made to the PublishForm.tsx component.
 * 
 * Enhancements:
 * 1. Added scrolling capability to the form by adding max-h-[90vh] and overflow-y-auto classes to the root container
 * 2. Added a close button in the top-right corner to allow users to easily dismiss the form
 * 3. Connected the close button to the onCancel prop
 * 4. Ensured proper display of the form when used in other components (AiMessage.tsx and DownloadOverlay.tsx)
 * 
 * These changes address the issues where users:
 * - Could not scroll within the form
 * - Could not close the form (no close button or functionality)
 * 
 * Implementation date: May 31, 2025

  {
    question: "How does the credit system work?",
    answer: "CodEase uses a simple pay-as-you-go credit system. Each credit costs $2 (or â‚¹170) and gives you one extension generation plus 5 follow-up refinements. Credits never expire and you can use them whenever you need them."
  },
  {
    question: "What can I do with each credit?",
    answer: "Each credit allows you to generate one complete Chrome extension and includes 5 follow-up refinements to perfect your extension. You also get full access to our live testing environment to test your extension before downloading."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) and our utility token CODON. Card payments are processed securely through Razorpay, while CODON payments are processed on the Solana blockchain."
  },  {
    question: "What is CODON and how does it work?",
    answer: "CODON is our utility token that enables more efficient transactions with reduced fees. When you pay with CODON, a portion of tokens are burned (removed from circulation), creating deflationary pressure. You can purchase credits using CODON at current market rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell extensions I create on CodEase?",
    answer: "Yes! You can publish and sell your extensions on our marketplace using CODON tokens. Other users can discover and purchase your extensions, creating an additional revenue stream for your creations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do credits expire?",
    answer: "No, credits never expire! Once purchased, they remain in your account until you use them. This gives you complete flexibility to generate extensions whenever you need them."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the live testing environment?",
    answer: "Our live testing environment lets you test your generated extensions in a real browser environment before downloading. Each testing session lasts 10 minutes and is available for all users with credits."
  },
  {
    question: "What are follow-up refinements?",
    answer: "Follow-up refinements allow you to improve and modify your extension after the initial generation. Each credit includes 5 follow-ups, so you can ask for changes, bug fixes, or feature additions to perfect your extension."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your refund policy?",
    answer: "We do not offer refunds for credit purchases. All sales are final once processed. However, since credits never expire, you can use them whenever you're ready."
  },  {
    question: "Are there any additional costs?",
    answer: "For credit card payments, all prices include applicable taxes (18% for Indian customers) which are added at checkout. CODON payments don't have additional taxes, but network fees may apply for blockchain transactions."
